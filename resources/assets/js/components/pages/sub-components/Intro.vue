      <p>This is is my first website built on the Laravel PHP framework. Right now, it is very much a work in progress which I will be adding to in the days and weeks to come. Using backpack base, I built out an admin panel then built out the front end.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, I have built websites in Wordpress. I am still using Wordpress but trying to branch out into Laravel, and front-end technologies, starting with gaining a mastery of vanilla JS then progressing through the popular frameworks (React is likely the first). I'm also interested in Data Visualization and Data Analysis, and have been studying a bit of Python on the side.</p>

      <p>Please be patient while I get this site in order!
